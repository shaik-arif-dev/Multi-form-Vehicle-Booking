# 🚗 Multi-form Vehicle Booking

A full-stack application that allows users to book different types of vehicles—cars (Hatchback, SUV, Sedan) and bikes (Cruiser)—while ensuring **no overlapping bookings**. Built with **Node.js (Express.js)**, **Sequelize ORM**, and **MySQL**.

## 🗃️ API Endpoints

### 🔍 Vehicle Types & Vehicles

| Method | Endpoint             | Description           |
| ------ | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/vehicle-types` | Get all vehicle types |
| GET    | `/api/vehicles`      | Get all vehicles      |

### 🚗 Bookings

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                          |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/api/bookings` | Create a booking with conflict check |

#### Sample Booking Request:

```json
{
  "vehicleId": 1,
  "user": "john.doe@example.com",
  "startDate": "2025-06-07T09:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2025-06-10T18:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## ⚡ Booking Conflict Check

* Before creating a booking, the API checks if the requested vehicle is already booked for **any overlapping time period**.
* Uses Sequelize's `Op.between` and `Op.or` to detect overlaps.

---

## 🗄️ Database Structure

**Tables:**

* `vehicletypes` (id, name, category, wheels)
* `vehicles` (id, name, typeId)
* `bookings` (id, vehicleId, user, startDate, endDate)

---

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

* Input validation on both frontend and backend.
* Use of Sequelize ORM to prevent SQL injection.
* Proper error handling with meaningful status codes.
* Use of foreign key constraints for data integrity.
